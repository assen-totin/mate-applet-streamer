This is a MATE panel applet toch allows you to lisnet to your favourite 
streaming media. 

When the applet starts, it will load the last the radio station you listened 
to. Click on the applet to toggle its state from "pause" to "play"; click it
again to pause it.

To manage your stations, right-click the applet and go to the "All" menu. 

On the 'Favourites' tab you can add new stations (name and URL required, the 
URL includes the protocol), remove existing ones or begin playing one. You 
can also reorder the stations there. The list will be saved on each change.

On the 'Icecast' tab you can download the full Icecast directory (it will be
saved after this), search through it, listen to a station or copy one to the
Favourites list.

On the 'Custom' tab you can load your local list of stations. The file has
to be XML compatible with the Icecast format:

<directory>
	<entry>
		<server_name>Radio 1 (AAC+)</server_name>
		<listen_url>http://icecast.omroep.nl/radio1-bb-aac</listen_url>
		<genre>Generic</genre>
		<bitrate>128</bitrate>
	</entry>
	<entry>
		...
	</entry>
	...
</directory>

When the applet starts, it will also load the top 10 recent stations and the 
top 10 favourites into two separate sub-menus in the right-click menu. From 
them you can launch a station too. Due to panel limitations, these two sub-
menus cannot be updated dynamically and will only change on applet start.
